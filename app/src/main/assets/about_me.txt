Welcome to Jyoti's Shop.

We’re so proud of our process that we’ve designed our pizzerias so you can watch.
We invite you into our open kitchens to watch the dough for your pizza being rolled ultra-thin in the famous Neapolitan style.
To get a bit giddy when you see your toppings fall into place.

Think of us as a new spin on a familiar story.
We’re the traditional pizzeria you’ve always loved at heart, but in a modern space that just feels—in a word—fresh.
We build our shops from the ground up, with some of that original Boston spirit baked right in. You might even catch a wicked good, if you listen.

While you’re here, you’ll discover our real secret: our people.
We’re people-people. And we take care of our people, always looking to help them grow as we do.

Now with 10 shops in the US, growing is what we’re doing a lot of lately.
But our pizza? Also brings people back. It’ll be nice to see you again soon.

We live to put a little BETTER in your day with everything we do.
That means teaming up with proven local vendors and organic farms to handpick premium ingredients.
It means building a team that lives and breathes our values.
With every bite of our delicious award-winning thin crust pizza, you’ll realize that you’ve just discovered something amazing.
Something BETTER.
